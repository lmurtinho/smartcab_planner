# smartcab_planner
This is my capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, in which I use reinforcement learning ($Q$-learning) to come up with a planner that learns which actions to perform in order to reach a point in a grid-like world.

This project was heavily inspired by the nanodegree's Project 4, Teach a Smartcab How to Drive. In fact, this project can be seen as using $Q$-learning to come up with the planner that is provided in that project.
